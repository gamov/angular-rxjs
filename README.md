# angular-rxjs ![CI status](https://github.com/gamov/angular-rxjs/actions/workflows/github-ci.yml/badge.svg)
Showcase some of the RxJS operators in the context of Angular; with their corresponding tests. 🍷

You can run all tests with `npm test`.
You can run the application in development mode with `npm run start` to see what the observables do. 🍿

That's pretty much all it is! 🥂


Suggestions and pull requests are welcome! Share your favourite operator!
