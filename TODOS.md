## Ideas
- test streamControlComponent
- a scenario with defer(); doing something when someone subscribes
- a scenario with finalize(); doing something when stream terminates and or observer unsubscribes
- attempt to make an observable like 'currentValueOrDefault' which does not complete and transparently offers the underlying observable once started (defer or make an observable from scratch)
